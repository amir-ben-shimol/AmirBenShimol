As a developer who enjoys building frontend applications, I’ve always appreciated React's flexibility and simplicity. However, Next.js has become my preferred choice for most projects due to its powerful features and built-in optimizations. Here’s my take on when to use Next.js versus React, with a focus on frontend development.

### When Pure React Shines

React is fantastic when you want complete control over your project’s structure.

It’s great for small to medium-sized projects where you can set up everything exactly as you like, from routing to state management.

You might prefer React if you’re building a highly custom or experimental project where you don’t need all the extra features that Next.js provides.

### Why Next.js is My Go-To

After trying out Next.js, especially with the new App Router in the latest versions, I’ve found it hard to go back.

Next.js simplifies a lot of things, like routing and data fetching, making development faster and easier.

With Next.js, you get server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) out of the box, which are excellent for performance, especially in SEO-focused projects.

### Example with Next.js App Router

Here’s a simple example using the new Next.js App Router:

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
	return <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App</h1>;
}
```

Routing is now file-based, and this \`page.tsx\` automatically becomes the homepage.

For data fetching, you can use server components or fetch data directly in your components:

```tsx
// app/blog/page.tsx
async function getPosts() {
	const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
	return res.json();
}

export default async function Blog() {
	const posts = await getPosts();
	return (
		<div>
			{posts.map((post) => (
				<h2 key={post.id}>{post.title}</h2>
			))}
		</div>
	);
}
```

With this setup, Next.js handles both SSR and SSG, depending on your needs.

### Performance and Scalability

React requires more manual setup for things like routing, SSR, and performance optimization. It’s fine for smaller projects, but it can get complicated as the project grows.

Next.js, on the other hand, comes with these features built-in, which saves time and helps your app scale more easily.

### My Conclusion: Next.js for Most Projects

For new projects, especially those that need to scale or require fast performance, I now default to Next.js.

It’s developer-friendly, speeds up the development process, and has great out-of-the-box features.

That said, React is still a solid choice if you need full control or if you’re working on a smaller, more customized project.

Ultimately, the choice between Next.js and React depends on your project’s specific needs and your team’s preferences.
